# MetaJSON

The MetaJSON descriptive language is a JSON format-based language that allows a program to define the JSON format of its outputs, and then validate that the output adheres to the defined schema, all programmatically. Think of it as an abstract description of the set of all possible JSON files your program can theoretically create.

> The purpose of this language does not hide in a single program itself however when you define or describe your JSON output you normalize it for other programs so that their deserialization and further serialization of the processed data will be much simpler and easier.
