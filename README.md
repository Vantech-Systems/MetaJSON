# JSOND

The JSON descriptive language is a JSON format based language that allows a program to define the JSON format of its outputs, and to then validate that ouput adheres to the defined schema, all programmatically.

> The purpose of this language does not hide in a single program itself however when you define or desribe your JSON output you normalize it for other programs so that their deserialization and futher serialization of the processed data will be much simpler.
